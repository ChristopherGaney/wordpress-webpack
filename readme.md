# HTML5Blank-foundation

You can run 'npm install' to install the dependencies and 'npm run start or npm run build' to compile or build your sass and js files.

This starter theme was last updated on 1/13/21 by Christopher Ganey after we built the AlanWire website.

There is another starter theme called HTML5Blank-foundation-SA (in Bitbucket) being used by the Migration Team and it is customized for using a page builder as well as ACF. This is not that starter theme, though they may be merged in the future.
